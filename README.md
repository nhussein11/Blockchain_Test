# Blockchain_Test
Testing simple blockchain algorithm and creating small criptocurrency 

For 'Blockchain.py', use Anaconda to create a virtual workspace, install Flask with "pip install Flask" and check out the functionality of the algotithm with Postman (using a GET method and 'http://localhost:5000/get_chain', to obtain current information about the blockchain, or 'http://localhost:5000/mine_block', to timestamping and mining a new block in the chain)
